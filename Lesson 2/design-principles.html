            <p>Mule Deer Foundation implements good use of white space and clean design. It has decent white spacing between
                its images and menu options which are encased in an image for each menu option. I feel that this is a smooth 
                design and works well on mobile.

            <h2>Alignment:</h2><a target="_blank" href="https://snowbird.com/">Snowbird</a><img src="imagesrd\snowbirdresized.png"
                alt="mobile screenshot of Snowbird.com">
            <p>Snowbirds mobile page uses a good grid pattern layout. It allows the user to easily navigate the page and the 
                contents are displayed well. The page adapts well to the size as it is enlarged and decreased and stays user friendly.

        <div id="Amazon">
            <h2>Contrast:</h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.Amazon.com/">Amazon</a><img
                src="imagesrd\Amazonresized.png" alt="mobile screenshot of Amazon.com">
            <p>Although Amazon can be overwhelming with all of the adds on the main page and throughout of items they have for sale. I 
                feel that they use a good amount of colors and those colors are not overwhelming to the eyes. They use a good amount of whites
                space and a grid pattern as well. Everything is also left to right which flows with how most users read.
